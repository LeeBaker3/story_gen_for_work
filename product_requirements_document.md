# 3. Technical Requirements

## 3.1 Backend
*   Framework: Python FastAPI
*   OpenAI APIs:
    *   ChatGPT API: Returns story content in structured JSON format.
    *   AI Image Generation API (e.g., OpenAI's image API): Generates images based on page-specific prompts.
*   Functionality:
    *   Accepts user inputs (including an optional story title) and sends prompts to ChatGPT.
    *   If no title is provided by the user, generates a suitable story title based on the outline and other parameters.
    *   Parses and stores story (including title), pages (with a dedicated title page as the first page), and image metadata in a SQLite database.
    *   Generates a cover image for the title page using the AI image generation model, based on the final story title, overall themes, and main character descriptions.
    *   Generates PDF combining story text and locally stored images.
    *   Provides an endpoint to retrieve a list of stories for the authenticated user.
    *   Generates and stores character reference images based on detailed user input, to be used in subsequent image generation prompts for consistency.
    *   Supports different selectable image styles for AI image generation, with styles potentially managed dynamically.
    *   Manages adjustable word-to-picture ratios for story layout.
    *   Supports different selectable writing styles for ChatGPT, with styles potentially managed dynamically.
    *   Implements a secure 'Forgot Password' mechanism (e.g., token-based).
    *   Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between regular users and admins.
    *   Provides CRUD endpoints for managing dynamic list content (e.g., genres, image styles) accessible only by admins.
    *   Handles user-defined story titles, allowing for creation and updates.
    *   Generates a cover image for the title page using the AI image generation model, based on the story title, themes, and character descriptions.
    *   Securely stores and manages API keys (e.g., OpenAI API Key), accessible/modifiable only by admins.
    *   Provides mechanisms to ensure data integrity when dynamic list items (e.g., genres, styles) are modified or deleted by an admin. This includes strategies like soft deletes, preventing deletion of in-use items, or indicating usage to the admin.
    *   Provides endpoints for admins to manage users (view, activate, deactivate, delete).
    *   Provides endpoints for admins to moderate content (list all stories, delete stories).
    *   Provides endpoints for admins to view system statistics and access application logs.
    *   Provides endpoints for admins to manage application configurations (e.g., API keys, maintenance mode) and send broadcast messages.

    *   ApplicationConfig (setting_name, setting_value, description)
    *   BroadcastMessages (message_id, content, created_at, created_by, is_active)
*   Features:
    *   Stories are searchable by title.
    *   Users can edit and re-export stories.
    *   Image files are stored locally and linked in the DB.
    *   Strategies for handling stories linked to modified/deleted `DynamicListItem` values:
        *   Retain original value string in the `Stories` table if a linked `DynamicListItem` is deactivated or its label changes.
        *   Prevent hard deletion of `DynamicListItem` if it's referenced by any story; use an `is_active` flag instead (soft delete).
        *   Admin interface should indicate if a `DynamicListItem` is in use before allowing deactivation or modification.

*   Graceful failure messages for:
    *   API timeouts/failures.
    *   Image generation errors.
    *   Invalid JSON responses.
*   Centralized, config-driven logging:
    *   Logging is configured via `config/logging.yaml` using `logging.config.dictConfig`.
    *   Daily rotating files (UTC midnight) for app, api, and error logs stored under `data/logs/`.
    *   Environment overrides for log levels: `APP_LOG_LEVEL`, `API_LOG_LEVEL`, `ERROR_LOG_LEVEL`.
    *   Base64 image payloads are redacted from logs for safety.

## 3.5 State Management & Recovery Story Generation Process
*  Process Tracking: The system shall track the progress of the story generation process, including the current step (e.g., "Generating reference images for characters") and the number of attempts made so far.
*  Timeout Detection: The system shall detect when a timeout occurs during the process and pause or retry the process accordingly.
*  Smart Retry Mechanism**: The system shall implement a smart retry mechanism that:
    *   Avoids retrying the same step multiple times in quick succession (to prevent infinite loops).
    *   Increases the delay between retries to prevent overwhelming the server with consecutive requests.
*  Uses a maximum number of attempts before giving up on the process.
*  Resume from Previous Attempt: The system shall be able to resume the process from where it left off, including re-trying failed steps and resuming image generation if necessary.
*  Error Handling: The system shall handle errors that occur during the process, such as OpenAI API errors or server-side errors, and provide meaningful error messages or logging information.

### 3.5.1 Additional Requirements:**
*  Process State Management**: The system shall maintain a state machine to track the progress of each step in the process.
*  Cache Mechanism**: The system shall consider implementing a cache mechanism to store intermediate results (e.g., generated images) to reduce processing time and improve performance.

*   **FR-ADM-11: Data Integrity for Dynamic Content (System/Admin):** The system will implement strategies to handle data integrity when dynamic list items (e.g., genres, image styles) are modified or deleted by an admin. This includes:
    *   Indicating in the admin panel if a dynamic list item is currently in use by existing stories.
    *   Implementing "soft deletes" (marking items as `is_active = false` but retaining them for historical data integrity). Hard deletes of in-use items should be prevented.
    *   Ensuring stories continue to display their originally selected values (e.g., genre name) even if the corresponding list item is later deactivated or its label changed. The story itself should store the value string, not just a foreign key, or have a clear mechanism to retrieve the historical value.
    *   Providing admin tools or considerations for migrating existing story data if a list item's value is critically changed (e.g., correcting a significant spelling error in a genre that should be reflected everywhere).

## 4.7 Testing
*   **FR-TEST-01:** Unit Tests: Implement comprehensive unit tests for all backend modules (CRUD operations, AI service interactions, API endpoints). (Previously FR10)

# 9. Development Progress

This section tracks the major milestones and completed work items.

## 9.1 Core Functionality Debugging & Enhancements (Completed Q2 2025)
*   Resolved critical frontend JavaScript error ("null is not an object") in `frontend/script.js` affecting character input fields, enabling proper form reset and interaction.
*   Addressed and resolved multiple backend Python errors, including:
    *   Initial 401 Unauthorized issues during login (enhanced logging in `auth.py`, `main.py` to diagnose).
    *   OpenAI API `APIRemovedInV1` errors (resolved by clearing `__pycache__`).
    *   `bcrypt` version conflict (`AttributeError: module \'bcrypt\' has no attribute \'__about__\'`) (resolved by `pip uninstall/install` of specific versions and updating `requirements.txt`).
    *   Python `ImportError` due to incorrect Uvicorn execution command (corrected command provided).
    *   `ValueError: OPENAI_API_KEY not found` due to misplaced `.env` file (moved `.env` to project root).
*   Improved backend logging in `ai_services.py` by replacing `print()` statements with structured logging for better traceability of API calls and errors.
*   Enhanced AI image generation error diagnosis by adding full prompt logging in `backend/ai_services.py` when image generation API errors occur.
*   Resolved JavaScript error "Can't find variable: resetFormAndState" in `frontend/script.js` by ensuring proper function scope and definition, improving form stability.
*   Corrected story finalization payload structure in `frontend/script.js` (addressing 422 Unprocessable Content errors) to ensure successful creation and finalization of stories, including those initiated from drafts (related to FR-STORY-10).
*   Improved user experience after story generation: users now remain on the story preview page instead of being immediately redirected to the story creation form.
*   Enhanced date display in "My Stories" view: timestamps (e.g., "Created", "Generated") are now converted to the user's local time for better readability.
*   Resolved frontend freeze during new story generation by improving error handling and ensuring spinner is hidden in `frontend/script.js`.

## 9.2 Frontend Enhancements (Completed Q2 2025)
*   Implemented clearer session timeout handling in `frontend/script.js`: On 401 errors, the application now displays a "session timed out" message and redirects the user to the login page, clearing any stale session data.

## 9.3 Project Setup & Maintenance (Completed Q2 2025)
*   Cleaned the project workspace by removing extraneous and incorrectly placed folders.
*   Initialized a Git repository for the project to enable version control.
*   Configured a remote origin and performed an initial push of the project to GitHub (`https://github.com/LeeBaker3/story_gen_for_work.git`).

## 9.4 Documentation (Ongoing)
*   Updated `product_requirements_document.md` to include a backend requirement for listing user stories.
*   Continuously updating this document to reflect new features, completed work, and pending tasks.

## 9.5 Backend Enhancements (Completed Q2 2025)
*   Fixed "Method Not Allowed" error for "My Stories" by adding a `GET /stories/` endpoint in `backend/main.py`.
*   Added a `GET /genres/` endpoint in `backend/main.py` to provide a sorted list of `StoryGenre` enum values.
*   Updated `backend/schemas.py` with a `StoryGenre` enum and modifications to `CharacterDetail`.

## 9.6 New Feature Implementation (In Progress / Pending)
### 9.6.1 Detailed Character Creation (FR-STORY-03)
